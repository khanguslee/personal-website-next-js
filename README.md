# Personal Website

A simple personal portfolio website styled in my favourite code editor theme.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

The project is automatically built and deployed onto the Vercel platform after each commit to the `master` branch.
